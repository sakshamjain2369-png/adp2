QUICK START GUIDE - RUN THIS IN POWERSHELL
===========================================

1. Open PowerShell
2. Change to the project directory:
   cd "c:\Users\Saksham\Documents\advanced programming final\online_book_project"

3. Run the app:
   python main.py

4. Try these actions:
   - Click "+ New Book"
   - Fill in: Title, Author, Year, pick a Category
   - Click "Save Book"
   - The book should appear in the table
   - Select the book and click "Delete"
   - Confirm deletion

5. Run the backend test to verify file saves:
   python full_test.py

WHAT'S BEEN FIXED:
==================
✓ Storage path now resolves to project root (media.json will be found)
✓ BookManager auto-persists changes (add/delete/edit save immediately)
✓ GUI dialogs are now modal and grab focus
✓ Add/Edit/Delete buttons have direct function references
✓ All actions reload from disk after completion
✓ Error handling shows what went wrong

IF ADD/DELETE STILL NOT WORKING:
================================
Check:
1. Is the GUI window still open when you try to add/delete?
2. Do you see any error messages?
3. Is media.json in the online_book_project folder?

Send the error message and I'll fix it immediately.
